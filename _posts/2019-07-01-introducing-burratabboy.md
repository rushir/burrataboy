title: Introducing burrata boy
---

Hey there! My name is [Rushir](https://imrushir.com) and I've had a fascination for pasta for a long time. The different shapes, the tastes of sauces and cheeses, the firmness of the noodles. So many things have to come together to form the perfect bowl of pasta. But, to have a good dining experience, not only does the food have to be good; the ambiance does as well, as does the service quality, and so on. This site can be used in two ways:
* As an introspective look into what I'm eating
* A review site, so you know where to eat  

So, how do we know what matters? Eventually we'll figure out all the criteria that should be used when judging the perfect bowl (and feel free to [email me](mailto:rushikh@gmail.com) if you have thoughts!), but for now we'll use the rating criteria below.

### Rating criteria

* Taste (the most important of them all!)
* Consistency (can you expect the same bowl each time you go back?)
* Service
* Ambiance
* Price
Bonus
* Creativity (does this restaurant try unconventional dishes?)

### What's next?

Over the next several days I'll be writing up a few reviews of some restaurants I've had the pleasure of eating at in New York. Be on the lookout for: L'Artusi, Pasquale Jones, and Maialino.

Thanks for reading!
