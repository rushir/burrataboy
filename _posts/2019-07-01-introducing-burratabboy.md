title: Introducing burrata boy

Hey there! My name is [Rushir](https://imrushir.com) and I've had a fascination for pasta for a long time. The different shapes, the tastes of sauces and cheeses, the firmness of the noodles. So many things have to come together to form the perfect bowl of pasta. But, to have a good dining experience, not only does the food have to be good; the ambiance does as well, as does the service quality, and so on.

For a while now I've been a fan of [The Infatuation](https://www.theinfatuation.com/)â€”a review site where writers offer their opinion on where you should eat. This site is essentially the same. Here, I offer you my opinion on where and what to eat. This site can be used in two ways:
* As an introspective look into what I'm eating
* A review site, so you know where and what to eat  

But, before we go further, you have to understand the criteria by which I judge my food. At first the criteria won't be perfect (and feel free to [email me](mailto:rushikh@gmail.com) if you have thoughts!), but for now we'll use the rating criteria below.

### Rating criteria

* Taste
* Consistency
* Service
* Ambiance
* Price

Bonus
* Creativity

### What's next?

Over the next several days I'll be writing up a few reviews of some restaurants I've had the pleasure of eating at in New York. Be on the lookout for: [L'Artusi](https://www.lartusi.com/), [Pasquale Jones](https://www.pasqualejones.com/), and [Maialino](https://maialinonyc.com/).

Thanks for reading!
