Alright, I lied about having the first post out quickly.

If I had a restaurant it would probably take a lot of queues from Pasquale Jones. Allow me to break it down for you: music selections include your favorite New York hip-hop artists, the bathroom soap is from Aesop, they have seats outside, it's located in the heart of Nolita, its close to [my favorite milkshake shop](https://www.milkandcreambar.com/)... and we haven't even gotten to the food yet.

## Little Neck Clam Pizza
I've never had clam on a pizza, it seems pretty unusual, but its a good combo. Drizzle some of the chili pepper oil on the pizza while its still hot.

## Tortellini with Morel Mushrooms

The pasta on the other hand is hard to describe. In a good way. It melts in your mouth. In one bite it has you saying, "wow". It's one of those dishes you eat as slowly as you can to preserve the time you have with it. The pasta noodle itself is perfectly cooked. The ricotta(?) filling is soft and melts away. The mushrooms are slightly salty and have a bit of bite to them. The presentation is beautiful - with edible flowers!
