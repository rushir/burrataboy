Alright, I lied about having the first post out quickly â€” but for good reason! I've been pretty busy with work and while I haven't had time to sit down and write, I have had time to eat. So stay tuned for more reviews soon.

If I had a restaurant it would probably take a lot of queues from Pasquale Jones. Allow me to break it down for you: music selections include your favorite New York hip-hop artists, the bathroom soap is from Aesop, they have seats outside, it's located in the heart of Nolita, its close to [my favorite milkshake shop](https://www.milkandcreambar.com/)... and we haven't even gotten to the food yet.

## Tortellini with Morel Mushrooms
![tortellini](/assets/photos/04_19_19_pasquale_jones.jpg)

The tortellini at Pasquale Jones is hard to describe. In a good way. It melts in your mouth. In one bite it has you saying, "wow". It's one of those dishes you eat as slowly as you can to preserve the time you have with it. The pasta noodle itself is perfectly cooked. The ricotta filling is soft and melts away. The mushrooms are slightly salty and have a bit of bite to them. The sauce is basically butter. Doesn't get much better than this folks.
