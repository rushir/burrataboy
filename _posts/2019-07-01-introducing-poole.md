title: Introducing burrata boy

Hey there! My name is [Rushir](https://imrushir.com) and I've had a fascination for pasta for a long time. The different shapes, the tastes of sauces and cheeses, the firmness of the noodles. So many things have to come together to form the perfect bowl of pasta. This site can be used in two ways:
* As an introspective look into what I'm eating
* A review site, so you know where to eat  

Eventually we'll figure out all the criteria that should be used when judging the perfect bowl of pasta, but we'll start with the following:

* Taste

### What's included

Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html), [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/atom.xml), posts, and [example page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

Additional features are available in individual themes.

### Browser support

Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Poole is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
