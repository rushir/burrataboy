<em>Oh man, oh man, oh man. The cacio e pepe at this place is :chef's kiss:</em>

So in yesterday's [review of Pasquale Jones](https://burrataboy.com/2019/08/12/Pasquale-Jones/), I mentioned it's older brother â€” [Charlie Bird](https://charliebirdnyc.com/). In many ways its similar, but feels a bit less formal, does away with the pizza, and adds a bit of seafood to the mix.

Located in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, Charlie Bird is a spot where you'd be just as comfortable sitting at the bar by yourself as you would with a group of friends at one of the tables outside. By the way, I'm not certain of this but I think there is a little mini wood burning stove outside (you can smell the goodness when seated outside).

## Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe

This cacio e pepe is really good. Does the noodle remind me a bit of the [maggi](https://www.amazon.com/Maggi-Masala-2-Minute-Noodles-India/dp/B00MXAY92A/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=maggi&qid=1565673034&s=gateway&sr=8-3) I ate growing up? Yes. But that's not stopping me from coming back for seconds. To me, cacio e pepe is one of those dishes that seems really simple, but actually takes a decent amount of effort to get right. The reason being that there is no real "sauce", instead its a perfect combination of pasta water, cheese, and pepper that's required to get the consistency right. These people get it.

## Gnocchi

To be completely honest, I don't remember everything that was in here. I do remember eating it outside though on a warm summer day. The gnocchi was firm (tbh, not sure if its supposed to be - I've had gnocchi that was super soft) and the sauce was rich. Every now and then I'd get a bite of pink peppercorn which quite frankly I'm not a huge fan of, but this dish would 100% feel like it was missing something if the peppercorns weren't there. If there is something else on the menu that strikes your fancy, try that too.
